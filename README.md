# The Boltzmann Machine
The Boltzmann Machine is a stochastic artificial neural network. It has some intriguing properties and is of great interest to theoretical neuroscience and cognitive neuroscience.

Open the jupyter notebook "Boltzmann machine.ipynb" for a short introduction of the Boltzmann Machine.

BM.py contains the class BoltzmannM, which is a simple implementation of the most basic conceptualisation of the Boltzmann Machine (so far only with visible neurons and no hidden neurons).
